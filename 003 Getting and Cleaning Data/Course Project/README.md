## Author:Fernando Barranco Rodríguez

#### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

*Description:*
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis: 
1. a README.md
2. a code book that describes the variables and the data
3. a script performing the analysis
4. a tidy data set

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung_Galaxy_S smartphone.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

**Note: The "run_analysis.R" script is highly detailed on how the data transformation was done, please read it carefully.**

*The "run_analysis.R" script was built under R version 3.4.1 -- "Single Candle" and performed on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 x64bits OS.*
