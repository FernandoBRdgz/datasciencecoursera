## Author:Fernando Barranco Rodr√≠guez

#### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

*Description:*
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis: 
1. a README.md
2. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations on the data
3. a script performing the analysis
4. a tidy data set

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung_Galaxy_S smartphone.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
